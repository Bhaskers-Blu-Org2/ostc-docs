# Installing git on Linux

Installing git on Linux is very easy. Compared to the UNIX systems,
installing git on Linux is a joy! :smiley:

You basically have several choices:

* If possible, install with the native package manager with a command
like:<br>
```yum install git``` (for RPM-based distributions), or <br>
```apt-get install git``` (for DPKG-based distributions).<br>
Of course, if you install from the installation media, most Linux
distributions include git there as well.
* If that's not possible, install from source. [Download]
(https://github.com/git/git/releases) the latest version and install
with commands like:
```
make
sudo make install
```
