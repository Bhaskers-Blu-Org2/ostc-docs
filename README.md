Documentation for the OSTC team

Please note that this is a public repository, and I'd like to keep it
public so public repositories can refer to sections of this. This avoids
duplication of documentation, which avoids repository documentation
becoming stale over time.

Please keep this in mind when adding documentation to this repository.

1. Infrastructure Information
  1. [Build Hosts](BuildHosts.md)
  2. [Installing git on UNIX/Linux](gitInfo/README.md)
2. Setup Instructions for Code Contributors
3. Workflow for Code Contributors
