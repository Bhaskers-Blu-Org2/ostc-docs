Documentation for the OSTC team

Please note that this is a public repository, and I'd like to keep it
public so other public repositories can refer to sections of this
repository. This avoids duplication of documentation, which helps
avoids repository documentation becoming stale over time.

Please keep this in mind when adding documentation to this repository.
